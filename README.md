Play MP3 Timer: Automate Your Audio Playback with Python and Task Scheduler
Python
Task Scheduler

🎵 Purpose of This Project
The Play MP3 Timer project is designed to automate the playback of an MP3 file at regular intervals using a Python script. Whether you're creating ambient sounds for productivity, reminders, or just fun background music, this setup ensures your audio plays on time without manual intervention.

This README will guide you through setting up the Python script, automating it with Windows Task Scheduler, and troubleshooting common issues.

🚀 How It Works
Python Script : The core functionality is handled by a Python script (play_mp3_timer.py) that uses libraries like playsound or pygame to play an MP3 file.
Batch File (Optional) : A batch file simplifies running the Python script by encapsulating the command in a single executable file.
Task Scheduler : Windows Task Scheduler is used to run the script at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) automatically, even if you're not logged in.
📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x Installed : Download it from python.org .
Required Libraries : Install the necessary Python libraries:
bash
Copy
1
pip install playsound
Alternatively, you can use pygame for more advanced audio control:
bash
Copy
1
pip install pygame
Windows Operating System : This guide is tailored for Windows users leveraging Task Scheduler.
🛠️ Setup Instructions
Step 1: Save Your Python Script
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad) or your favorite Python IDE.
Write or copy your Python script to play the MP3 file. Example:
python
Copy
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
from playsound import playsound

# Path to your MP3 file
mp3_file = "C:/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3"

# Play the MP3 file
playsound(mp3_file)
Save the file as play_mp3_timer.py.
Example path: C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\play_mp3_timer.py.
Step 2: Create a Batch File (Optional)
A batch file makes it easier to execute the script via Task Scheduler.

Open Notepad.
Paste the following code, replacing the path with your Python script's location:
batch
Copy
1
python "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\play_mp3_timer.py"
Save the file as run_play_mp3_timer.bat:
File name: run_play_mp3_timer.bat.
Save it in the same directory as your Python script or wherever you prefer.
Ensure you select "Save as type: All Files" in Notepad.
Step 3: Open Task Scheduler
Press Win + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
Type taskschd.msc and press Enter to open Task Scheduler.
Step 4: Create a New Task
In Task Scheduler, click Create Task on the right-hand side.
Fill out the fields:
General Tab :
Name: Give your task a name, e.g., "Play MP3 Timer."
Description: Add a description if desired, e.g., "Runs Python script every hour to play MP3."
Check Run whether user is logged on or not .
Check Run with highest privileges .
Triggers Tab :
Click New to create a new trigger.
Select Daily and set the Start time to when you want the task to begin.
Under Advanced settings, check Repeat task every and set it to 1 hour.
Set the Duration to Indefinitely or a specific timeframe.
Actions Tab :
Click New and select Start a Program .
If you created the batch file, browse to your .bat file.
Alternatively, directly use the Python interpreter:
Program/Script: python.exe (or full path to your Python executable, e.g., C:\Python39\python.exe).
Add arguments: "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\play_mp3_timer.py" (path to your script).
Conditions Tab :
Uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power (if you want this to run on laptops on battery power).
Settings Tab :
Check Allow task to be run on demand .
Check If the task is already running, then the following rule applies: Stop the existing instance .
Click OK . You may be asked to enter your Windows account password.
Step 5: Test the Task
Find the task you just created in Task Scheduler.
Right-click on it and select Run to test if it works.
If it’s working, the script will execute in the background, playing the MP3 file at the scheduled intervals.
Step 6: Ensure Python is in PATH (Optional)
If your task fails and Python isn't in your system’s PATH, you’ll need to add it:

Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables .
In the System Variables section, find Path and click Edit .
Add the path to your Python installation directory (e.g., C:\Python39).
Step 7: Monitor the Task
You can monitor your task by:

Opening Task Scheduler and checking the Last Run Time and Last Run Result columns.
Troubleshooting any errors (e.g., incorrect paths).
🎯 Use Cases
Productivity : Play ambient sounds or focus music at regular intervals.
Reminders : Use audio cues to remind you to take breaks or stay hydrated.
Entertainment : Automate playlists for parties or events.
🐛 Troubleshooting
Script Fails to Run : Ensure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
MP3 File Not Found : Double-check the file path in your Python script.
Task Scheduler Errors : Verify the task's settings, especially the script path and Python interpreter location.
