## üéµ Purpose of This Project

The **Play MP3 Timer** project is designed to automate the playback of an MP3 file at regular intervals using a Python script...

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Python Script**: The core functionality is handled by a Python script (`play_mp3_timer.py`)...
2. **Batch File (Optional)**: A batch file simplifies running the Python script...
3. **Task Scheduler**: Windows Task Scheduler is used to run the script...

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x Installed**: Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install playsound

  Alternatively, you can use pygame for more advanced audio control:
  pip install pygame

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Step 1: Save Your Python Script
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad) or your favorite Python IDE.
Write or copy your Python script to play the MP3 file. Example:
from playsound import playsound

# Path to your MP3 file
mp3_file = "C:/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3"

# Play the MP3 file
playsound(mp3_file)

Save the file as play_mp3_timer.py.

#### Step 2: Add Code Blocks
Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks. Specify the language (e.g., `python`, `bash`) for syntax highlighting.

Example:
```python
from playsound import playsound
playsound("C:/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3")
