## üéµ Purpose of This Project

The **Play MP3 Timer** project is designed to automate the playback of an MP3 file at regular intervals using a Python script...

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Python Script**: The core functionality is handled by a Python script (`play_mp3_timer.py`)...
2. **Batch File (Optional)**: A batch file simplifies running the Python script...
3. **Task Scheduler**: Windows Task Scheduler is used to run the script...

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x Installed**: Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install playsound

  Alternatively, you can use pygame for more advanced audio control:
  pip install pygame

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Step 1: Save Your Python Script
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad) or your favorite Python IDE.
Write or copy your Python script to play the MP3 file. Example:
from playsound import playsound

# Path to your MP3 file
mp3_file = "C:/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3"

# Play the MP3 file
playsound(mp3_file)

Save the file as play_mp3_timer.py.

#### Step 2: Add Code Blocks
Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks. Specify the language (e.g., `python`, `bash`) for syntax highlighting.

Example:
```python
from playsound import playsound
playsound("C:/path/to/your/audio/file.mp3")

Step 3: Use Emojis and Badges
GitHub supports emojis and badges. You can use them to make your README visually appealing.

Example:

Emoji: üéµ renders as üéµ.
Badge: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue) renders as Python .
Step 4: Save as .md
Save your file as README.md and upload it to your GitHub repository.

Final Check
After uploading, GitHub will automatically render the Markdown file. If something doesn‚Äôt look right:

1.Edit the file directly on GitHub.
2.Use the preview feature to see how it will look.
3.Make adjustments as needed.
